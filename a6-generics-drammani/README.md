# a6-generic-LL

Your task for this assignment is to convert this Linked List implementation
 that was given in A2 to be a generic solution. 
Currently this Linked List can only handle nodes with values that are ints. 
Once it becomes generic it should be able to work with any data type (doubles, Strings, Objects, etc..).
For how to get started on this, refer to the recorded Generics lecture on Sakai.
 
In order to do this you should revisit every method and make sure that it is compatible with generics. Be sure 
 to also update the Node and NodeImpl to also be generic. This 
includes updating method signatures and variable declarations and other details throughout the code 
(hint: you cannot use == to compare objects).

This assignment is due on the last day of class. We will not be accepting late submissions for this assignment.
Additionally we cannot provide office hours help for A6 other than technical difficulties. If you are having
autograder issues, make sure you have thoroughly tested your code before submitting. If the autograder fails
to compile that means that you have not properly converted everything to be generic so be sure to test every method
before submitting.
